### Content

```
I didn't take the traditional path into product management.

I started in political campaigns, where I learned that technology can change elections. I built voter targeting models, ran digital outreach programs, and managed teams trying to win competitive races. The work was intense, the stakes were high, and the tools we used were terrible.

That's what drew me to civic tech. I wanted to build the tools I wished existed when I was running campaigns. I joined organizations like Open Progress and Civitech, where I led product development for platforms that helped Democrats win elections. I worked on SMS outreach tools, voter databases, and AI-powered targeting systems. We reached millions of voters and helped hundreds of campaigns.

But I wanted to build products at a larger scale. I wanted to solve problems that affected not just campaigns, but everyday people using technology to get work done. So I went back to school.

At UC Berkeley Haas, I'm learning the business side of product management: strategy, go-to-market, leadership, and how to build products that people actually want. I'm focused on cloud infrastructure, AI/ML tools, and developer platforms—the kind of products that empower builders to create amazing things.

I'm drawn to Product Management because it combines everything I care about: understanding users, solving hard problems, working with talented teams, and building products that make a real impact. I love the challenge of balancing technical constraints with user needs, of prioritizing ruthlessly, and of shipping products that people love.

After I graduate in May 2025, I want to be a Product Manager at a company that takes craft seriously. Somewhere that builds products people love, invests in their teams, and cares about impact. I'm interviewing at places like Stripe, Atlassian, and Google Cloud—companies that share those values.

Long-term, I want to come back to civic tech as a founder. I want to build the political technology platform I wished existed when I was running campaigns—something that makes it radically easier for grassroots organizers to reach voters, raise money, and win elections. But first, I need to learn how to build world-class products at scale.

### Value Card 1: Build for real users
```
**Icon**: Users icon

**Title**: Build for real users

**Description**:
I care about building products that solve real problems for real people. Not vanity metrics, not theoretical features, but tools that people actually use and love. I start with user research, validate with data, and ship iteratively.
```

### Value Card 2: Empower builders
```
**Icon**: Tools icon

**Title**: Empower builders

**Description**:
The best products are tools that help people build even better things. I'm drawn to developer tools, platforms, and infrastructure—products that give creators leverage and make their work easier.

### Value Card 3: Move fast, learn faster
```
**Icon**: Lightning icon

**Title**: Move fast, learn faster

**Description**:
I believe in shipping quickly, learning from users, and iterating based on data. Perfect is the enemy of shipped. I'd rather launch a simple v1 and improve it based on real feedback than spend months building the wrong thing.
```

### Value Card 4: Lead with empathy
```
**Icon**: Heart icon

**Title**: Lead with empathy

**Description**:
Great products come from great teams. I believe in leading with empathy, listening to different perspectives, and creating environments where everyone can do their best work. I've managed teams in high-pressure campaigns and I know how to bring out the best in people.

### Content
```
When I'm not building products or studying for my MBA, you'll find me:

**Cooking new recipes** every week. I love experimenting in the kitchen—right now I'm working my way through the Ottolenghi cookbooks. There's something satisfying about following a process, iterating based on taste, and ending up with something delicious.

**Hiking in the East Bay hills**. Living in Berkeley means I'm 10 minutes from trails with incredible views. It's where I do my best thinking and clear my head after long weeks.

**Spending time with family** in Southern California. I'm close with my parents and siblings, and I try to get down to LA as often as I can. Family comes first.

**Following politics and elections** obsessively. Even though I'm not working on campaigns anymore, I still care deeply about democracy and civic engagement. I track races, read campaign post-mortems, and stay connected to the organizing community.

I believe in working hard, staying curious, and making time for the people and activities that matter. Life's too short to optimize only for career success.
