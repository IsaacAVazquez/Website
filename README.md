## Personal Website

This is my personal site built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS v4. The project also
includes Vite scripts which can be used if you prefer a Vite based workflow.

## Development

To run the project locally:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This starts the application on `http://localhost:3000` by default.
