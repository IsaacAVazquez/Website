# About Me

![Isaac Vazquez](/images/headshot.jpg)

## The Journey

I build products that bridge technology and human impact. It's a mission that's taken me from political organizing to quality engineering, and now to product management.

---

## The Beginning: From Politics to Tech

I started my career at the intersection of politics and technology, not in Silicon Valley, but in the trenches of political campaigns. After graduating from Florida State University with degrees in Political Science and International Affairs, I joined Open Progress — a civic tech firm helping progressive campaigns reach voters.

I thought I'd be crafting political strategy. Instead, I discovered something more powerful: **data-driven product development.**

While my peers focused on messaging, I became obsessed with the systems underneath — the analytics dashboards, the email platforms, the voter targeting algorithms. I saw that the real impact wasn't just in what we said, but in *how* we built the tools that let us say it.

## The Transformation: Finding Product Through Quality

In 2022, I made what seemed like an unconventional move: transitioning from campaign strategy to Quality Assurance at CIVITECH. People asked, "Why QA?"

The answer was simple: **I wanted to understand how great products are built from the inside out.**

QA taught me to think like both an engineer and a user. I learned to:
- Dissect complex systems to their core components
- Anticipate edge cases and failure modes before they happened
- Balance technical excellence with user needs
- Communicate across engineering, product, and business teams

But I didn't just stay in QA. I became a product-focused quality engineer, driving initiatives that generated $4M in additional revenue, owning product vision for entire platforms, and architecting quality strategies at organizational scale.

## The Evolution: From QA to Product Leadership

By 2024-2025, I wasn't just testing products — I was **defining** them.

**For TextOut:**
- Owned end-to-end product vision through user research and requirements definition
- Drove 35% engagement increase through thoughtful feature prioritization
- Transformed client data accessibility with GCP automation (90% faster onboarding)

**For RunningMate:**
- Led successful platform launch by translating stakeholder feedback into user stories
- Reduced critical defects by 90% through quality-driven development
- Increased NPS from 23 to 36 by obsessing over user experience
- Accelerated release velocity from monthly to biweekly

I realized: **The best products aren't just well-tested. They're well-conceived, well-designed, and built with deep empathy for users.**

## The Vision: UC Berkeley Haas & Beyond

In 2025, I enrolled at **UC Berkeley Haas School of Business** to formalize what I'd been learning through experience: how to build and scale products that matter.

As a **Consortium Fellow** and **MLT Professional Development Fellow**, I'm deepening my understanding of:
- Product strategy and go-to-market execution
- Venture capital and early-stage company building
- Fintech innovation and financial systems
- Leadership in technology organizations

### Short-Term Goals
Transition into a **Product Manager role** at a high-growth tech company, where I can leverage my unique background in quality engineering and civic tech to build products that scale and serve real user needs.

### Long-Term Vision
Launch a **political tech company** that fundamentally transforms how campaigns, nonprofits, and civic organizations leverage technology for social good. I've seen the gaps firsthand — outdated tools, fragmented data systems, and technology that serves vendors more than mission-driven organizations.

I want to build something better.

## What Drives Me

### 🎯 **Problem-Solving at Scale**
I'm energized by complex, ambiguous challenges where the right product decisions can unlock massive value. Whether it's optimizing a data pipeline to save 200 hours per sprint or designing features that increase engagement by 35%, I love finding elegant solutions to hard problems.

### 🌍 **Technology for Good**
Technology should empower people and strengthen communities. My civic tech roots remind me that behind every metric is a real person whose life can be improved — or harmed — by the products we build.

### 📊 **Data-Driven Decision Making**
I believe in rigorous analysis, A/B testing, and letting data guide strategy. But I also know when to trust intuition and qualitative insights. Great product management balances both.

### 🧠 **Continuous Learning**
From political science to SQL to product strategy, my career has been defined by intellectual curiosity. I'm constantly reading, building side projects (like my fantasy football analytics platform), and seeking new perspectives.

---

## Beyond Work

When I'm not building products or studying for my MBA, you'll find me:

- **Cooking** — Experimenting with new recipes (usually Texas BBQ or Mexican cuisine)
- **Hiking** — Exploring California trails and national parks
- **Election Organizing** — Still involved in civic engagement and voter mobilization efforts
- **Building Side Projects** — Currently: AI-powered analytics tools and civic tech prototypes
- **Reading** — Product strategy, venture capital, political philosophy, sci-fi
- **Fantasy Football** — Both playing and building analytics for it (yes, seriously)

## Values & Philosophy

**On Quality:**
> "Quality isn't just about finding bugs — it's about building trust, protecting users, and ensuring technology serves humanity's best interests."

**On Product Development:**
> "The best products are invisible. They solve problems so elegantly that users don't think about the technology — they just accomplish their goals."

**On Career Growth:**
> "Every system can be improved, every process can be optimized, and every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow."

**On Impact:**
> "Success isn't measured in features shipped or revenue generated alone — it's measured in real human problems solved and lives improved."
