# Let's Connect

## Open to Conversations About Impact

I'm always interested in meaningful conversations about product strategy, civic technology, building impactful products, or career journeys from engineering to product management.

---

## What I'm Open To

**💼 Product Management Opportunities**
I'm exploring Product Manager and Associate Product Manager roles at high-growth tech companies, particularly those focused on civic tech, SaaS platforms, fintech, or social impact. If you're building products that matter, let's talk.

**🏛️ Civic Tech Collaborations**
Passionate about technology for political campaigns, nonprofits, and advocacy organizations. Open to consulting, advising, or collaborating on civic tech initiatives.

**🎤 Speaking & Writing**
Available for talks, panels, or guest posts on topics including:
- Product management from a quality engineering background
- Building products in civic tech
- Transitioning from technical roles to product leadership
- MBA experiences and career pivots

**🤝 Mentorship & Networking**
Happy to chat with folks navigating similar career transitions, exploring product management, or interested in civic tech and political technology.

**💡 Side Projects & Innovation**
Always exploring new ideas at the intersection of AI, civic engagement, and product development. If you're working on something interesting, I'd love to hear about it.
