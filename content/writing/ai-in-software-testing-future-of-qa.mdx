    def __init__(self):
        self.baseline_model = ResponseTimeModel()
        self.anomaly_threshold = 0.95  # 95th percentile
    
    def detect_anomalies(self, performance_data):
        predictions = self.baseline_model.predict(performance_data)
        anomalies = []
        
        for actual, predicted in zip(performance_data, predictions):
            deviation = abs(actual - predicted) / predicted
            if deviation > self.anomaly_threshold:
                anomalies.append({
                    'timestamp': actual.timestamp,
                    'expected': predicted,
                    'actual': actual.value,
                    'severity': self.calculate_severity(deviation)
                })

    def validate_result(self, input_data, actual_output):
        # Generate expected result using learned business rules
        expected = self.rule_engine.predict(input_data)
        
        # Validate with confidence scoring
        confidence = self.validation_model.calculate_confidence(
            input_data, expected, actual_output
        )
        
        return {
            'is_valid': self.compare_outputs(expected, actual_output),
            'confidence': confidence,
            'explanation': self.generate_explanation(input_data, expected, actual_output)
        }
```

3. Test reset link works within 24-hour window
4. Test reset link expires after 24 hours
5. Test reset link can only be used once
6. Test successful password reset allows login with new password
7. Test email delivery to various email providers
```

**Implementation Approach:**
```python
class NLPTestGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.requirement_parser = RequirementNLP()
        self.test_template_engine = TestTemplateEngine()
    
    def generate_tests(self, requirement_text):
        # Parse requirements into structured format
        parsed_requirements = self.requirement_parser.analyze(requirement_text)
        
        # Extract testable conditions
        conditions = self.extract_testable_conditions(parsed_requirements)
        
        # Generate test cases for each condition
        test_cases = []
        for condition in conditions:
            test_template = self.test_template_engine.select_template(condition)
            test_case = test_template.generate(condition)
            test_cases.append(test_case)
        
        return test_cases
```

3. Invalid username, valid password
4. SQL injection attempts in username field
5. XSS attempts in password field
6. Account lockout after multiple failed attempts

Would you like me to add any specific scenarios or modify these tests?"

Tester: "Also test password requirements enforcement"

AI Assistant: "Adding password validation tests:
7. Password too short (less than 8 characters)

        # Analyze code complexity metrics
        complexity_score = self.complexity_analyzer.analyze(code_diff)
        
        # Predict bug probability based on historical data
        bug_probability = self.bug_risk_model.predict(code_diff)
        
        # Estimate required test coverage
        coverage_recommendation = self.test_coverage_predictor.recommend(code_diff)
        
        return {
            'risk_score': self.calculate_risk_score(complexity_score, bug_probability),
