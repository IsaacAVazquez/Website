## What is Fantasy Football?

### The Basic Concept

Fantasy football is a game where you act as the owner and general manager of your own NFL team. Instead of coaching real players, you "draft" NFL players onto your fantasy roster and earn points based on their actual NFL performance each week.

**Key Elements:**
- **Draft real NFL players** to build your fantasy roster
- **Set lineups** each week choosing which players to start
- **Earn points** based on your players' real NFL statistics  
- **Compete against friends** in head-to-head matchups
- **Make trades and waiver claims** to improve your team
- **Win your league** and potentially money/prizes

### How Fantasy Points Work

Your fantasy team scores points when your real NFL players perform well in their actual games:

**Typical Scoring Examples:**
- **Touchdown:** 6 points
- **100+ yards rushing/receiving:** Often 3+ bonus points
- **Field goal:** 3 points  
- **Passing yard:** 0.04 points (1 point per 25 yards)
- **Rushing/receiving yard:** 0.1 points (1 point per 10 yards)

**The Goal:** Score more fantasy points than your opponent each week to win your matchup.

### League Structure

**Regular Season (Weeks 1-14):**
- Play against different league members each week
- Win-loss record determines playoff seeding
- Highest-scoring teams usually make playoffs

**Playoffs (Weeks 15-17):**
- Top teams compete in bracket-style tournament
- Single-elimination format (lose once, you're out)
- Championship decided in Week 17

## League Basics and Settings

### Common League Formats

#### Standard Leagues (8-12 Teams)
- **8 teams:** Easier to find good players, higher scores
- **10 teams:** Balanced difficulty and availability
- **12 teams:** More challenging, requires deeper knowledge
- **14+ teams:** Advanced leagues with limited player pool

#### Roster Construction (Typical Setup)
```
Starting Lineup (9 players):
- 1 Quarterback (QB)
- 2 Running Backs (RB) 
- 2 Wide Receivers (WR)
- 1 Tight End (TE)
- 1 Flex (RB/WR/TE)
- 1 Kicker (K)
- 1 Defense/Special Teams (DST)

Bench (5-7 players):
- Backup players for bye weeks and injuries
- Potential starters and trade assets
- Future breakout candidates
```

### League Settings You Should Understand

#### Draft Type
**Snake Draft (Most Common):**
- Pick order reverses each round
- If you pick 1st in Round 1, you pick last in Round 2
- Balances advantage of early vs. late picks

**Auction Draft:**
- Every player available, bid with budget
- More complex but allows targeting specific players

#### Scoring System
**Standard Scoring:**
- No points for catches (receptions)
- Emphasizes touchdowns and yardage
- Running backs typically more valuable

**PPR (Point Per Reception):**
- 1 point for each catch
- Makes wide receivers and pass-catching RBs more valuable
- Most common format in modern leagues

**Half-PPR:**
- 0.5 points per reception
- Compromise between Standard and PPR

#### Waiver Wire System
**Waiver Priority:**
- Reverse standings order (worst team picks first)
- Resets weekly or after successful claims

**FAAB (Free Agent Acquisition Budget):**
- Each team gets budget ($100-1000)
- Blind bid system for free agents
- More strategic than simple priority

## Scoring Systems Explained

### Understanding Point Values

#### Quarterback Scoring
```
Passing Yards: 1 point per 25 yards (0.04 per yard)
Passing TDs: 4 points each (sometimes 6)
Interceptions: -2 points
Rushing Yards: 1 point per 10 yards
Rushing TDs: 6 points
```

**What This Means:**
- 300 passing yards = 12 points
- 2 passing TDs = 8 points
- Total: 20 points (good QB performance)

#### Running Back/Wide Receiver/Tight End
```
Rushing/Receiving Yards: 1 point per 10 yards (0.1 per yard)
Rushing/Receiving TDs: 6 points each
Receptions (PPR only): 1 point each
Fumbles Lost: -2 points
```

**Example WR Performance:**
- 8 catches (PPR) = 8 points
- 120 receiving yards = 12 points  
- 1 touchdown = 6 points
- Total: 26 points (excellent performance)

#### Kicker Scoring
```
Field Goals: 3-5 points (longer = more points)
Extra Points: 1 point each
Missed FG/XP: Usually -1 to -3 points
```

#### Defense/Special Teams
```
Points Allowed: 0-6 points (fewer points allowed = more fantasy points)
Yards Allowed: Bonus/penalty based on total yards
Turnovers: 2 points each (interceptions, fumble recoveries)
Sacks: 1 point each
Touchdowns: 6 points (return TDs, pick-6s)
Safeties: 2 points
```

### Scoring System Strategy Impact

**Standard Scoring Strategy:**
- Target touchdown-heavy players
- Running backs often more valuable
- Big-play receivers prioritized over possession guys

**PPR Scoring Strategy:**
- Target high-catch players (slot receivers, pass-catching RBs)
- Possession receivers gain significant value
- Pass-heavy offenses become more attractive

## Draft Day Fundamentals

### Pre-Draft Preparation

#### Research Phase (2-3 weeks before)
- **Learn your league settings** - scoring, roster size, rules
- **Study expert rankings** from multiple sources
- **Identify sleepers and breakouts** based on situation changes
- **Mock draft practice** using online simulators

#### Draft Day Setup
- **Stable internet connection** for online drafts
- **Rankings cheat sheet** printed or on second device
- **League rules handy** for reference during draft
- **Snacks and drinks** - drafts can last 2+ hours

### Basic Draft Strategy

#### Early Rounds (1-5): Secure Your Core
**Round 1-2 Priorities:**
- **Elite running backs** - scarcity at position
- **Top wide receivers** - consistent high-end production
- **Avoid quarterbacks** - too much depth at position
- **Skip kickers and defenses** - streamable positions

**Rounds 3-5:**
- **Fill RB/WR depth** before other positions
- **Consider elite tight end** if available
- **Target consistent producers** over boom-bust types

#### Middle Rounds (6-10): Value and Depth
- **Add positional depth** at RB/WR
- **Consider quarterback** if elite options still available
- **Target breakout candidates** with clear opportunity
- **Handcuff valuable RBs** if possible

#### Late Rounds (11+): Upside and Necessities  
- **Draft quarterback** if you haven't already
- **Add tight end** if needed
- **Target high-upside players** - rookies, situation changes
- **Draft kicker and defense** in final rounds

### Position-by-Position Draft Guide

#### Running Backs: The Scarcity Play
**Why RBs Are Valuable:**
- Fewer reliable fantasy producers than WR
- Injury rate higher than other skill positions
- Workload concentration in fewer players

**Draft Strategy:**
- **Rounds 1-3:** Target featured backs with heavy workloads
- **Rounds 4-6:** Look for committee members with upside
- **Rounds 7+:** Handcuff your starters, target breakouts

**Red Flags:**
- Aging backs (30+) with heavy recent usage
- Committee situations without clear leader
- Poor offensive lines limiting production

#### Wide Receivers: Volume and Consistency
**Why WRs Are Reliable:**
- More fantasy-relevant players at position
- Less injury-prone than running backs
- Longer career primes and consistency

**Draft Strategy:**
- **Rounds 1-2:** Elite, target-dominant receivers
- **Rounds 3-5:** High-floor WR2 types
- **Rounds 6+:** Upside plays, rookies, situation changes

**Target Profiles:**
- High target share (20%+ of team targets)
- Red zone usage and touchdown opportunities
- Young players with opportunity growth

#### Quarterbacks: Wait and Stream
**Why to Wait:**
- Deep position with streaming options
- Injury replacement usually available
- Points difference smaller than other positions

**Draft Strategy:**
- **Rounds 6-9:** Elite QBs if available at value
- **Rounds 10-12:** Solid starters with rushing upside
- **Rounds 13+:** Streaming options, backup with upside

**Target Types:**
- Dual-threat QBs (rushing adds safe floor)
- High-volume passing offenses
- Improved supporting cast situations

#### Tight Ends: The Position of Scarcity
**The TE Problem:**
- Only 3-5 consistently reliable fantasy producers
- Huge difference between elite and replacement level
- Often touchdown-dependent for big weeks

**Draft Strategy:**
- **Rounds 3-5:** Elite tier (if still available)
- **Rounds 8-11:** Mid-tier options with red zone role
- **Round 12+:** Streaming options, high-upside rookies

### Mock Draft Practice

**Why Mock Drafts Matter:**
- Practice your draft strategy
- Learn player values and ADP (Average Draft Position)
- Test different draft positions
- Get comfortable with draft platform

**Mock Draft Goals:**
- Complete 5-10 mock drafts before your real draft
- Try different strategies and positions
- Note which players consistently available at each spot
- Practice adapting when plans change

## Managing Your Team

### Weekly Lineup Decisions

#### Start/Sit Fundamentals
**Basic Principles:**
- **Start your best players** - don't get too cute
- **Consider matchups** but don't overthink
- **Check injury reports** before games
- **Account for weather** in outdoor games

**Position-by-Position Tips:**

**Quarterback:**
- Favor high floor over ceiling unless desperate
- Consider opponent pass defense ranking
- Weather matters more for QBs than other positions

**Running Backs:**
- Workload and game script most important
- Check for backfield committee changes
- Goal line role crucial for touchdown upside

**Wide Receivers:**
- Target share and role consistency
- Shadow coverage from elite cornerbacks
- Weather less impactful than for QBs

**Tight Ends:**
- Red zone role and target consistency
- Often touchdown-dependent for big games
- Streaming based on matchups viable

#### Game Time Decision Process
```
Sunday Morning Checklist:
1. Check final injury reports (inactives announced 90 minutes before kickoff)
2. Review weather forecasts for outdoor games
3. Confirm your starting lineup is set
4. Have backup plans for questionable players
5. Double-check bye weeks and late game changes
```

### Waiver Wire Management

#### Basic Waiver Strategy
**Priority Players:**
- **Injury replacements** for starter-level players
- **Breakout candidates** showing increased usage
- **Matchup-based streamers** for QB/TE/K/DST
- **Handcuffs** for your valuable RBs

**Weekly Process:**
1. **Tuesday:** Review snap counts and target distribution
2. **Wednesday:** Identify opportunity changes and news
3. **Thursday:** Submit waiver claims before deadline
4. **Friday:** Check for additional free agents

#### FAAB Budget Management
**Budget Allocation Guidelines:**
- **Early season (Weeks 1-4):** 15-25% for elite pickups
- **Mid-season (Weeks 5-10):** 5-15% for solid contributors
- **Late season (Weeks 11+):** 1-10% for depth and matchups

### Trading Fundamentals

#### When to Trade
**Good Reasons to Trade:**
- Fill positional weaknesses
- Consolidate depth into better starters
- Buy low on underperforming stars
- Sell high before expected decline

**Trade Timing:**
- **Early season:** After 2-3 weeks when patterns emerge
- **Mid-season:** Before trade deadline (usually Week 10-12)
- **Avoid:** During bye weeks when evaluating is difficult

#### Trade Evaluation
**Basic Trade Analysis:**
1. **Who helps your starting lineup more?**
2. **Which side gets the best player?**
3. **How do bye weeks align?**
4. **What are playoff schedules like?**

**Simple Trade Framework:**
```
Your Gain = (Players Received Value) - (Players Traded Value)
Consider: Starting lineup improvement + schedule + bye weeks
```

## Essential Strategy Concepts

### Understanding Player Value

#### Tiers vs. Individual Rankings
**Tier-Based Thinking:**
- Group similar players together
- Any player within tier roughly equivalent
- Focus on tier breaks rather than specific ranks
- Allows flexibility in draft and trades

**Example WR Tiers:**
```
Tier 1 (Elite): Players 1-5 - Clear #1 options
Tier 2 (Strong WR1): Players 6-12 - Reliable weekly starters  
Tier 3 (WR2): Players 13-24 - Solid contributors
Tier 4 (Flex): Players 25-36 - Matchup dependent
```

#### Positional Scarcity
**Scarcity Concept:**
- Fewer reliable players = higher individual value
- More available players = lower individual value
- Draft scarce positions earlier, deep positions later

**2025 Scarcity Rankings (Most to Least Scarce):**
1. **Elite Tight Ends** (3-5 reliable options)
2. **Workhorse Running Backs** (12-18 clear starters)
3. **High-Target Wide Receivers** (24-30 weekly starters)
4. **Consistent Quarterbacks** (15-20 viable options)
5. **Kickers/Defenses** (streaming viable)

### Game Script and Matchup Analysis

#### Understanding Game Script
**Positive Game Script (Team Ahead):**
- More rushing attempts
- Clock control focus
- Lower passing volume
- Defense gets more opportunities

**Negative Game Script (Team Behind):**
- Higher passing volume
- Hurry-up offense usage
- Fewer rushing attempts
- Potential garbage time production

**Using Vegas Lines:**
- **Point Spreads** predict likely game script
- **Over/Under Totals** indicate pace and volume
- **Team Totals** project offensive output

#### Matchup Evaluation
**Key Matchup Factors:**
- **Opponent strength** vs. specific positions
- **Pace of play** affecting total opportunities  
- **Weather conditions** for outdoor games
- **Injury situations** creating opportunity

**Streaming Positions (QB/TE/K/DST):**
- Target weekly favorable matchups
- Don't hold multiple players at these positions
- Use matchup rankings and expert advice
- Consider home/away and weather factors

### Roster Construction Strategy

#### Balance vs. Upside
**Championship Teams Need:**
- **Reliable weekly starters** (high floor players)
- **League-winning upside** (high ceiling players)
- **Positional depth** for bye weeks and injuries
- **Streaming flexibility** at K/DST

**Roster Allocation Strategy:**
```
Starters (70% of roster value):
- Target consistency and weekly usage
- Avoid boom-bust players in key roles
- Prioritize proven producers

Bench (30% of roster value):  
- Mix of reliable depth and upside plays
- Handcuff valuable RBs
- Stash breakout candidates
```

#### Bye Week Management
**Bye Week Planning:**
- **Draft players with different bye weeks** when possible
- **Monitor weekly bye distributions** 
- **Plan waiver moves** 2 weeks in advance
- **Consider package trades** to consolidate byes

**Bye Week Weeks:**
- Most teams have byes Weeks 6-11
- Weeks 9-10 typically heaviest bye weeks
- Plan roster construction around these periods

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Drafting Based on Team Loyalty

**The Problem:**
Drafting players from your favorite NFL team regardless of fantasy value.

**Why It's Bad:**
- Emotional attachment clouds judgment
- Team success doesn't equal fantasy production
- Limits your player pool unnecessarily
- Creates bias in weekly lineup decisions

**The Fix:**
- Draft best available players regardless of team
- Use fantasy rankings, not team allegiance
- Remember: You want individual player success, not team wins
- Keep favorite team allegiance separate from fantasy

### Mistake #2: Overvaluing Quarterbacks Early

**The Problem:**
Drafting quarterbacks in first 4-5 rounds when better values exist later.

**Why It's Bad:**
- Deep quarterback pool with streaming options
- Skill position scarcity more important
- Point differential smaller between QB tiers
- Easier to replace QB than RB/WR

**The Fix:**
- Wait until rounds 6-8 for first quarterback
- Consider streaming approach entirely
- Target QBs with rushing upside later in draft
- Focus early picks on RB/WR scarcity

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Waiver Wire

**The Problem:**
Setting draft lineup and forgetting about roster management.

**Why It's Bad:**
- 40-60% of championship roster comes from waiver wire
- Injuries and breakouts happen every week
- Streaming positions can provide weekly advantages
- Competition will get better through wire activity

**The Fix:**
- Check waiver wire every Tuesday/Wednesday
- Set claims for promising players
- Stream QB/TE/K/DST based on matchups
- Stay active throughout season

### Mistake #4: Starting Players on Bye Weeks

**The Problem:**
Forgetting to check bye weeks and starting players who don't play.

**Why It's Bad:**
- Automatic zero points from that roster spot
- Often decides close matchups
- Shows lack of preparation
- Wastes potential from bench players

**The Fix:**
- Check bye weeks every Tuesday
- Set calendar reminders for bye weeks
- Plan waiver pickups week in advance
- Use apps that notify about bye weeks

### Mistake #5: Making Emotional Lineup Decisions

**The Problem:**
Benching good players after one bad game or starting favorites despite poor matchups.

**Why It's Bad:**
- Small sample sizes mislead
- Good players have bad games occasionally
- Matchup overreaction leads to wrong choices
- Emotional decisions usually backfire

**The Fix:**
- Trust season-long data over one week
- Consider matchups but don't overthink
- Start your best players consistently
- Avoid knee-jerk reactions to recent games

### Mistake #6: Poor Trade Evaluation

**The Problem:**
Making trades without considering fair value or team needs.

**Why It's Bad:**
- Giving away too much value
- Not improving starting lineup
- Ignoring positional needs
- Trading away depth at wrong time

**The Fix:**
- Use trade value charts for reference
- Consider who improves starting lineup more
- Don't trade depth during bye weeks
- Get second opinions from trusted sources
