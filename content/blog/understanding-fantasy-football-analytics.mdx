## Why Traditional Stats Fall Short

### The Problem with Box Score Statistics

Traditional fantasy football analysis relies heavily on:
- **Total yards and touchdowns** - outcome-based metrics
- **Fantasy points per game** - results without context  
- **Season-long totals** - ignoring volatility and trends
- **Positional rankings** - relative performance without absolute value

**These metrics miss crucial context:**
- **Opportunity distribution** - How many chances did a player get?
- **Efficiency rates** - How well did they use their opportunities?
- **Situational usage** - When and how are they deployed?
- **Sustainability factors** - Are current results repeatable?

### The Misleading Nature of Results-Based Analysis

Consider two wide receivers:
- **Player A:** 1,200 yards, 8 TDs on 120 targets
- **Player B:** 900 yards, 12 TDs on 90 targets

Traditional analysis favors Player A, but analytics reveal:
- Player A: Lower efficiency, higher volume, TD-dependent
- Player B: Higher efficiency, consistent red zone role, more stable

Understanding these differences helps predict future performance and identify value.
