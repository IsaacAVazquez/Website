# Contact surface brief

**Scope.** The `/contact` route, rendered by `src/components/catalog97/Catalog97Contact.tsx`. One of the seven Catalog 97 surfaces.

**Visitor mode.** Persuade. Deliberately the shortest of the seven.

**Job / action.** Send one message through a channel that actually works.

**Route constraints.** THERE IS NO CONTACT FORM AND ONE MUST NOT BE ADDED. The source design draws four fields and a send button; this repo has no form backend, so shipping that markup would look right and silently drop every message. The design's own tobacco line says email is faster than the form and gets read first, so the direct panel takes the weight the form would have had. Do not raise the missing form as a finding.

**Visual world: Catalog 97, not Working Instrument.** `DESIGN.md` describes The Working Instrument and governs the other ~40 routes. It does NOT govern this surface. `context.mjs` auto-loads it anyway, so a pass that treats it as the spec here will read every deliberate Catalog 97 decision as a violation and manufacture a page of false findings. Tokens live in `src/app/catalog97.css`.

**Do not re-litigate (settled 2026-08-02).**
- Tobacco is a large-text-only field. Paper ink on it is 4.36:1, which clears 3:1 for large text and never clears 4.5:1 for body. A tobacco band carries `--c97-fs-h2` (24px floor) and up, or no text at all. Not a defect; solved by size rather than by darkening the colour.
- Anton draws numerals at `--c97-fs-plate` only. Never running text, never headings, and there is no smaller numeral step. This replaced the earlier one-Anton-per-view rule.
- The scales are frozen: 9 type steps, 8 spacing values (`--c97-gutter` plus `--c97-sp-1..7`), 4 line heights, 3 measures plus `--c97-container`. `--c97-touch-y/x` sit outside the spacing ladder on purpose, solved backwards from the 44px floor.
- Every `--c97-*` value is declared under `[data-c97]` or `[data-c97-surface]`, never under a class, so a token consumer can skip class rules wholesale.
- Image slots render as flat Stone or Tobacco fields because no photograph exists yet. That is the design’s own layout rule, not an unfinished asset.

**Verified state.** 0 contrast failures across 2774 text nodes in both themes, each resolved against its own enclosing surface and backdrop. Zero shadows, zero radii above 2px, zero off-palette hex in components. `focus-visible` covers anchors, buttons, inputs, textareas, selects and summaries. Exactly one `aria-current` per route. Espresso footer present. No two Pine bands adjacent, and at least two brown bands per route.

**Commands worth running.** `critique` and `audit` to find. Then only what the findings name. `polish` last. Never `document` here (it would regenerate DESIGN.md against the wrong world), and never both halves of `bolder`/`quieter` or `overdrive`/`distill`.

**Settled 2026-08-02 (critique, degraded single-context).** The anchor reset is `:where(.c97-page) a`, not `.c97-page a`. At `.c97-page a` it scored (0,1,1) and outranked every single-class component rule, so each `.c97-btn` rendered as a `<Link>` discarded its own `color: var(--c97-surface)` and inherited the band ink instead. Measured live: "See the work" was espresso on chocolate at 1.4:1, and `.c97-btn-invert`, whose background is `--c97-ink`, was heading for 1:1 invisible text on six routes. All 13 buttons on the site are anchors, so all 13 were affected. Static token-math audits miss this because they read the declared rule rather than the winning cascade. Do not raise the `:where()` back to a plain class, and re-measure buttons in a browser after any change to the anchor reset.

**Settled 2026-08-02 (mobile pass).** The header wordmark carries `.c97-brand`, which applies the same padding-plus-negative-margin hit target as `.c97-microlink`. At 390px it measured a 23px tap target before this, under the 44px floor the rest of the site holds; it is 55px now. Dark mode is verified live rather than by token math: all eight surfaces render their derived dark values and both themes measure zero contrast failures. When re-measuring after a theme toggle, wait a tick before reading computed styles — reading in the same synchronous block returns the pre-toggle paint and looks like dark mode is broken when it is not.
